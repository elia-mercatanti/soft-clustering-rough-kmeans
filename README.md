# Soft Clustering and Rough K-Means
Project for Multivariate Analysis and Statistical Learning (MASL) Course - Soft Clustering and Rough K-Means

Four approaches for sosft clsutering are described and analyzed from a theoretical point of view and from an
empirical comparative analysis, in particular we will focus on the Rough approach, also providing an 
implementation in R of a version of it based on the K-Means clustering algorithm.

Developed in R.
